github quickstart quide tutorial thing
I'm using some time this summer to figure out some coding things that I might be able to add to my physics curriculum for the upcoming school year.  I have only very introductory knowledge of programming.  I'm hoping by doing this tutorial, I can learn some physics related programming ideas and also not be distracted or overwhelmed while trying to use the githun platform.
